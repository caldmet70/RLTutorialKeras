In this repository, I am trying to write tutorials on popular Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. I will design the Neural Networks using Keras, as Keras is popular now and most important it's pretty enough easy for beginners to learn. As there is not enough Deep Learning Tutorials in Bangla, Tutorials would be both in English and Bangla. As for now I have selected the following ones for the topic of my tutorials:
- Q Learning
- Deep Q Network
- DDPG
- A2C

In future I may add more tutorials.
