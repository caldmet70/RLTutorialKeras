In this repository, I am trying to write tutorials on popular Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. I will design the models using Keras, as it is popular now and most importantly, it's very easy for beginners to learn. As there aren't enough Deep Learning Tutorials in Bangla, I am planning to write in both English and Bangla. As for now, I have selected the following ones for the topic of my tutorials:
- Q Learning
- Deep Q Network
- DDPG
- A2C

In future I may add more tutorials.
