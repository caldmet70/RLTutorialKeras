    "One of the problems in Reinforcment learning is relearning Problem. That is , suppose, in the course of trial and error, one state $s_t$ comes only once or twice, and never comes back. What will happen? There is a chance that the Agent will forget that experience after some time- like us! . So we need to make the agent keep some kind of track of that memory as well. This problem was solved in 1993- yes 26 years ago- by Long Ji lin. In his paper, ***Reinforcement Learning for Robots Using Neural Networks*** , he introduced the concept of Experience Replay. What he did was, he initialized a buffer of a certain size . He stored the experiences of the agent, i.e. state $s_t$, action $a$,next state $s_{t+1}$, reward $r$ . Before training the agent, he you just sample randomly from the buffer . It also helps randomizing the data , which in turn, helps to converge the model faster, as mentioned by Yoshua Bengio in his paper ***Practical Recommendations for Gradient-Based Training of Deep\n",

It means, at first you just ***explore*** different actions , the more you take actions the less you explore and more use your previouse experience to guide you-known as ***exploit***.  This thing can be done using a technique -with another freaking out name- $\\epsilon$-greedy policy. "
